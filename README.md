Description :-
This modal will allow users to share a profile on a social media platform. The Share Modal Profile project aims to enhance user interaction by providing a seamless way to share a user's profile or content. Through a 
combination of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, the project creates a visually appealing and user-friendly modal window. Users can trigger the modal through a button, view profile 
information, and easily share it on various platforms, with attention to responsive design for a consistent experience across devices. This code sets up a basic HTML structure with a user profile container and a 
"Share Profile" button. The CSS styles provide a simple layout, and the JavaScript handles the modal functionality and allows users to share the profile on WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram .
